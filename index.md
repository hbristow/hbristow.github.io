I'm a computer vision engineer currently developing perception algorithms for
autonomous vehicles. I have a particular interest in image-based object detection,
passive sensing, and the remarkable capacity and efficacy at which humans
perceive the natural world.

I previously studied at the Queensland University of Technology in Australia,
under the supervision of [Dr Simon Lucey](http://simonlucey.com). My research
focussed on unsupervised image alignment and object registration. I have worked
on a number of open source projects, notably the [OpenCV library](http://opencv.org).

I take an avid interest in programming languages and language design,
and along with being fluent in C++ and Python, my style is heavily
influenced by functional programming and Common Lisp.
My mathematical background is in linear algebra and optimization theory.
